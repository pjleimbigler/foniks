# Phonics Playground

An interactive phonics learning tool for children ages 4 and up. This web application helps children learn letter sounds and phonemes through a fun, interactive interface.

## Features

- Draggable letter tiles that can be arranged to form words
- Stacked letter system with 3 copies of each letter available
- Ability to rearrange letters by dragging within the word area
- Drag letters back out of the word area when needed
- Insert new letters between existing letters in the word area
- Support for words up to 9 letters long
- Text-to-speech pronunciation of any letter combination
- Special celebration when complete words are spelled
- Word-specific emoji associations (e.g., "cat" shows a cat emoji)
- Interactive tile placement with smooth animations
- Visual feedback and sound effects for all interactions
- Simple and intuitive interface designed for young children
- Modal celebration window for successfully spelled words

## How to Use

1. Drag letter tiles from the stacks into the drop zone to build words (limit of 9 tiles)
2. Rearrange letters by dragging them within the drop zone
3. Insert new letters between existing ones by dragging to the gap indicators
4. Remove letters by dragging them out of the drop zone or clicking on them
5. Click "Speak Word" to hear your word pronounced
6. When you spell a complete word in our dictionary, a special celebration modal appears with the corresponding emoji
7. Click the green checkmark to close the celebration modal
8. Click "Clear All" to start over with a new word
